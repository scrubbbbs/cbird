 jpegquality:
 Estimate the quality of the JPEG based on the quantization tables.

    JPEGs are in a fixed file format:
      6 bytes = header
      Optional global
      Set of blocks.
         Each block has a type, size, and data.

    The quantization tables are type 0xffdb.
    Each type 0xffdb may contain 1 or more quantization tables.
    The tables define the compression based in luminance (Y),
    chrominance-red (Cr) and chrominance-blue (Cb).
      - Most programs use two tables: one for Y and one for both Cr and Cb.
        Some programs use one 0xffdb with both tables in it, while other
        programs use one 0xffdb for each quantization table.
      - Some programs (mostly digital cameras) use three tables: Y, Cr, Cb.
        I have never seen a case where Cr != Cb, but it is possible.
        I usually see one 0xffdb with all 3 tables in it.
        However, it is possible to have two or three 0xffdb tags.
    This code does not check if there are 2 or 3 tables.  It blindly
    prints out the average after each chrominance table.
    If there are 3 tables, then you should look at the last average
    quality since it is computed correctly.

    In addition to multiple quantization tables per image, a JPEG may
    contain multiple images at different resolutions.  This program will
    pull out the quantization tables found in each image.

       Technically, JPEG uses YCrCb.

         B = Y + (B-Y) = Y + Cb
       and in reverse (YCrCb):
         Luminance = Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
         Cr = R-Y = R - (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B)
         Cb = B-Y = B - (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B)
       The quantization tables are based on Y and CrCb and
       they mainly differ by a factor of 0.51 (from determining G).
       Thus, we compute the difference using 1 - 0.51 = 0.49.
       The results will be off by a fraction, but that's noise
       considering all of the integer rounding.
